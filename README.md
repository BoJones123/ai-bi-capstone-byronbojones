## 📦 Project Overview

This capstone project demonstrates how to use advanced generative AI tools, including LangChain, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Large Language Models (LLMs), to transform raw business data into actionable insights.

The project applies these methods to a provided sales dataset (`sales_data.csv`) and delivers:
✅ Descriptive analytics  
✅ Segmentation insights  
✅ Visualizations  
✅ Example AI pipeline integrations
